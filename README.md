# Responsive-Level-1-Assignment-3
In this assignment, I extended the responsive site for my Garden Centre by applying CSS Flexbox and Grid systems. These techniques were used to create a more structured and flexible layout for the Home and Plants pages, improving responsiveness across different screen sizes. Flexbox and Grid systems allowed for precise control over the alignment and distribution of content, further enhancing the siteâ€™s adaptability and user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
